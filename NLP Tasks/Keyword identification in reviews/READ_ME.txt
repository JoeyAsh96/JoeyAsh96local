# Product Feature Analysis from Gaming Product Reviews

This mini-project builds upon the sentiment analysis system developed in the "Sentiment Analysis of Android App 
Reviews" project (linked [here](link to your previous project if possible)).  Here, the Python NLTK library is 
leveraged to identify common product features mentioned by customers in Amazon reviews of gaming products.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be used to extract valuable 
insights into specific product attributes mentioned in customer reviews.  By focusing on positive reviews, we 
can pinpoint the features that customers appreciate most.  This type of analysis is invaluable for businesses 
seeking to understand which aspects of their products or services are resonating with their customer base.

## Motivation

While the previous sentiment analysis project focused on determining the overall sentiment (positive, negative, 
or neutral) of reviews, this follow-up project delves deeper.  It opens the door for more granular analysis, 
particularly of negative reviews.  By understanding *what* specific features are disliked by customers, 
businesses can gain actionable insights to improve their offerings and better meet customer expectations. This 
project serves as a stepping stone towards that goal by first identifying the most praised features.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into four Python code sections (Questions 1-4) and a final report (Question 5):

* **Questions 1-4 (Python Code):** These sections contain the core NLP code for processing the gaming product 
reviews. They cover tasks such as:
        * Tokenization and stemming/lemmatization of review text.
        * Identification of named entities (NER) related to product features.
        * Frequency analysis of feature mentions in positive reviews.
* **Question 5 (Report):** This report summarises the findings of the analysis. It presents the most frequently 
mentioned product features in positive reviews and discusses the potential implications for businesses.  

## Key Features and Technologies

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Core techniques for text processing and analysis.
* **Feature Extraction:** Identifying specific product attributes mentioned in reviews.
* **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** Python library used for NLP tasks.
* **Python:** The programming language used for this project.
